# 🔱 ORION — Optimal Real-Time Intelligent Prompt Generator
A hybrid rule-based + LLM powered system for **prompt optimization**, **safety enhancement**, and **adaptive refinement**.  
ORION intelligently analyzes user prompts, understands intent, injects missing details, enforces structure, eliminates ambiguity, and enhances clarity — all while learning from its own performance through a transparent feedback loop.

## ⚡ Features
### **🔍 Intelligent Task Recognition**
ORION classifies user prompts into task types:
- Coding  
- Academic writing  
- Creative writing  
- Summarization  
- Reasoning  
- Transformations  

### **🧠 Hybrid Optimization Engine**
Combines:
- **Rule-Based Expert System** (structure, constraints, templates)  
- **LLM Enhancer** (style, coherence, flow, chain-of-thought)  

### **📏 Multi-Dimensional Scoring Engine**
Evaluates prompts on:
- Clarity  
- Specificity  
- Completeness  
- Task Alignment  
- Safety  
- Structural Quality  

### **🔁 Adaptive Feedback Loop**
Learns over time by adjusting:
- Rule weights  
- Constraint enforcement strength  
- Detail-injection intensity  
- Safety rule strictness  
- Classification patterns  

This allows ORION to improve without retraining any machine learning model.

### **🛡 Advanced Safety Layer**
- Jailbreak pattern detection  
- Harmful intent neutralization  
- Safe reformulation of risky inputs
